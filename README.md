# Combine Neural Cleanse with K-means Clustering for Detecting All-to-one Parallel Multi-trigger Backdoor Attacks

Official implementation of a post-training defense method that leverages Neural Cleanse reverse engineering and K-means clustering to identify and distinguish multi-trigger backdoor patterns in DNNs. Evaluated on CIFAR-10.
